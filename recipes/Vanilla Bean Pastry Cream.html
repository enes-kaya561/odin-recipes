    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>1 large whole egg</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place whole egg and 2 egg yolks into a mixing bowl. Add sugar, corn starch, and salt. Whisk together completely until mixture turns from yellow to a very page creamy color and is slightly thickened, 5 to 8 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place milk in a saucepan. Split vanilla bean lengthwise. Scrape the cut side with a paring knife to extract the seeds (paste). Add the seeds to the milk. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until milk just barely starts to simmer and a few small bubbles appear on the surface. Remove from heat. Whisk hot milk into egg mixture, starting with a small splash then incorporating the rest. Pour mixture back into saucepan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place pan over medium-low heat and continue to whisk until mixture begin to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool 5 minutes. Add chunks of butter and whisk until butter melts into the warm milk mixture. Pass mixture through a fine mesh strainer to remove and chunks of cooked egg or vanilla seeds. Cover surface with plastic to keep it from discoloring; refrigerate until thoroughly chilled 2 to 3 hours.</p></li>
    </ol>
